Logistic Regression is a simple, yet powerful classification method. The question we will address in this article is: given a patient's temperature in Fahrenheit, determine if the patient has the flu or the common cold. Note that we are trying to predict a qualitative value (flu or cold) rather than quantitative (a number). Let us encode the two medical conditions as \(\{1,2\}\) for flu and cold respectively.

<h1>Logistic Function and Log Odds</h1>
In logistic regression, we model the probability of a patient having the flu given a temperature \(t\) with the <b>logistic function</b>,

$$ Pr(Y=1\mid T=t) = \frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1t}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1t}}$$

For convenience, let us define \(p(t)=Pr(Y=1\mid T=t)\). With a bit of algebra, we can obtain the <b>log odds</b> or <b>logit</b>,

$$\log{\frac{p(t)}{1-p(t)}} = e^{\beta_0+\beta_1t}$$

Using the log odds helps us interpret the relationship between \(\beta_1\) and \(T\). Specifically, increasing \(T\) by one unit changes the log odds (or logit) by \(\beta_1\). It is important to note that a one unit increase in \(T\) <em>does not</em> correspond to a \(\beta_1\) change in \(p(t)\). Rather, it depends on the current value of \(T\) since \(p(t)\) is a non-linear function.

<h1>Estimating Regression Coefficients</h1>
How do we estimate \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\)? First, we need a dataset and typically a method known as <em>maximum likelihood</em> is used. In our case, a dataset would be a collection of different patient's temperatures and their respective medical conditions (flu or cold). Assume we have observations \(\{(t_1, y_1), (t_2, y_2) \ldots , (t_n, y_n)\}\) where \(t_i\) is patient \(i\)'s temperature and \(y_i \in \{1,2\}\) for flu and cold respectively. Then the likelihood function we want to maximize is,

$$l(\beta_0,\beta_1)=\prod_{i:y_i=1} p(t_i) \prod_{i':y_{i'}=0}(1-p(t_i))$$

The Newton-Raphson algorithm is one option for solving this optimization problem.

<h1>Making Predictions</h1>
After estimating the coefficients, we can compute probabilities using the following equation and plugging in the estimated \(\beta\)s,

$$\hat{p}(t)=\frac{e^{\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1t}}{1+e^{\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1t}}$$

For concreteness, let our estimated parameters for our logistic regression model to predict medical condition from temperature be \(\hat{\beta}_0=-29\), \(\hat{\beta}_1=.3\) and \(X=110\). The predicted probability of a patient having the flu given a temperature of 110 degrees Fahrenheit is,

$$\hat{p}(X)=\frac{e^{-29+.3*110}}{1+e^{-29+.3*110}} = .98$$

Based on our logistic regression model, the probability of him having the flu is 98%!

<h1>Extensions to Multiple Predictors and Classes</h1>
We can generalize our formulation to allow for multiple predictors. Let \(X\) denote the predictors and G the response. The updated logistic function and log odds are,

$$\log{\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \ldots + \beta_pX_p$$
$$p(X)=\frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X+\ldots + \beta_pX_p}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X+\ldots +\beta_pX_p}}$$

We can also extend logistic regression to allow for more than two classes. In this setting, each class is specified by its own log odds or logit transformation,

\begin{align}
    \log{\frac{Pr(G=1\mid X=x)}{Pr(G=K\mid X=x)}} & = \beta_{10}+\beta_1^Tx\\
    \log{\frac{Pr(G=2\mid X=x)}{Pr(G=K\mid X=x)}} & = \beta_{20}+\beta_2^Tx\\
    & \vdots\\
    \log{\frac{Pr(G=K-1\mid X=x)}{Pr(G=K\mid X=x)}} & = \beta_{(K-1)0}+\beta_{K-1}^Tx\\
\end{align}
