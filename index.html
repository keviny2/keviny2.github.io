Hello! I'm a consultant at Amaris Consulting. My current project centers around 
the development of API tools tailored to process single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, 
empowering impactful research applications.
<br><br>
During my time at UBC, I had the honor of contributing to cancer research. 
Specifically, I implemented state-of-the-art Bayesian models within the liquid 
biopsy domain, furthering innovation and discovery.
<br><br>
I'd love to connect with fellow professionals, share ideas, and collaborate on 
meaningful projects. Feel free to reach out!
