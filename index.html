Hello! I'm Kevin, a consultant at <a href="https://www.amaris.com/">Amaris 
Consulting</a>. My current project centers around the development of API
tools tailored to process single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. Concurrently, I am
contributing to open-source projects for implementing bioinformatic-specific
data structures.
<br><br>
During my time at UBC, I had the honor of contributing to cancer research. 
Specifically, I implemented state-of-the-art Bayesian models to estimate tumour 
burden for monitoring cancer progression using liquid biopsies.
<br><br>
Most importantly, I'm a husband and a father of one daughter. Take a look
<a href="/about/">here</a> for some photos! I'm also serving as a Ruling Elder at
<a href="https://faithvan.com/">Faith Reformed Presbyterian Church</a>.
<br><br>
I'd love to connect with you to share ideas and collaborate on 
meaningful projects. Feel free to reach out!
