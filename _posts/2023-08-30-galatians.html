excerpt: "A brief commentary of Galatians"
---

<p>
The epistle to the Galatians is directed to the entire region of Galatia, not 
to any particular church. Paul writes to address the infiltration of the 
'Judaizers', who teach that faith in Christ must be joined with the Law of 
Moses. At the same time, the Judaizers malign Paul, questioning authority as an 
apostle, causing believers in Galatia to doubt the veracity of Paul's teaching. 
It is in this context, Paul pens this epistle to preserve his own reputation 
and the glorious doctrine of justification by faith alone.

Paul opens with his characteristic introduction. After, he immediately 
transitions to rebuke the Galatian church for deserting the gospel. Paul’s 
language is extremely harsh (3:1, 5:12) and he communicates his perplexity 
regarding the matter (4:20). The Galatian church are quick to abandon the 
apostle’s teaching (1:6) to their own detriment. Paul reasons with the 
Galatians to compare the benefits of faith in Christ to the condemnation they 
receive under the law. He provides convincing arguments as to the folly of 
returning to the old ways of Judaism. Firstly, he asserts that a person is not 
justified by the law but by faith (2:16); secondly, he elaborates on the 
example of Abraham, how he was justified by faith alone apart from works of the 
law (3:6-9); thirdly, he explains the work of Christ in our redemption 
(3:10-14); and lastly, he contrasts the person who is justified by faith and 
the person who is in bondage to the law (4:1-31).

Another issue Paul addresses relates to his own person. The Judaizers 
successfully persuade the Galatians that Paul is at best, an inferior apostle. 
As a result, the Galatian church abandons the doctrine of justification by 
faith alone because of its connection to Paul. Therefore, Paul uses the first 
two chapters to establish the basis of his authority. He states that the 
teaching he received was not a figment of his own imagination, but rather a 
revelation directly from heaven (1:12). Furthermore, he shows the impossibility 
of him deriving his teaching from other men (1:16-22). Finally, he mentions 
obtaining the apostles' right hand of fellowship (2:9).

Next, Paul highlights the freedoms believers possess in Christ. Believers are 
no longer required to observe the law, but are called to freedom and ought to 
use this freedom to love and serve one another (5:13). The Law of Moses is 
superseded by the Law of Love (5:14); therefore, those who are led by the 
Spirit are no longer under the law (5:18). Paul enumerates the works of the 
flesh (5:19-21) and the works of the Spirit (5:22-23). After exhorting the 
believers in Galatia to bear each other's burdens and to continue in doing good 
(6: 2,9), Paul recapitulates the main theme of the entire epistle: “For neither 
circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.” 
(6:15).

<p>
The epistle to the Galatians is a plea to remain faithful to the doctrine of 
justification by faith alone. Martin Luther famously described justification by 
faith alone as “the doctrine on which the church stands or falls”. Using 
examples from the Old Testament, Paul, like a skilled master builder (1 Cor. 
3:10), points wavering believers back to the foundation of the apostles and 
prophets (Eph. 2:20). Paul displays his zeal for the truth in his aggressive 
confrontation of Peter (2:11-14) and his admonishment of the Galatians (1:6, 
3:1, 4:20-21, 5:12). The truth is too precious to let go of, so Christians 
ought to bless the world through faithful and courageous witness to the truth. 
As Christ himself said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” (John 14:6)
