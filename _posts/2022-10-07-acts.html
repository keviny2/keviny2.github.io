excerpt: "A brief commentary of The Acts of the Apostles"
---

<p>
Acts is the first written document on church history. It is penned by Luke the 
doctor, likely one of the seventy-two mentioned in Luke 10:1. If the four 
gospels shows the laying of the foundation, Acts shows the constructing of the 
superstructure. In particular, the book of Acts manifests the breaking down of 
the dividing wall of hostility (Eph. 2:14) and the inclusion of the Gentiles 
(Rom. 9:24-29). Acts is partitioned into three sections: the witness in 
Jerusalem (ch. 1-7), the witness in Judea and Samaria (ch. 8-12) and the 
witness to the ends of the earth (ch. 13-28).

The book of Acts picks up where the gospels end. After rising from the grave, 
Jesus appears to the apostles for forty days and promises them the Holy Spirit. 
Before his ascension, Jesus commands the Eleven to remain in Jerusalem (1:4). 
The witness in Jerusalem is initiated by the coming of the Holy Spirit during 
Pentecost, where divided tongues of fire rest on the apostles, enabling them to 
speak in tongues (2:9-11). Peter preaches a sermon, interpreting Old Testament 
prophecies (Joel 2:28-32, Ps. 16:8-11, Ps. 110:1), whereby three thousand are 
converted (2:41). Later, Peter and John heal a lame beggar (3:1-10), followed 
by a sermon ending with a call to repentance (3:11-26). The apostles face 
opposition from the religious leaders in Jerusalem, leading to threats (4:18, 
5:28) and imprisonments (4:3, 5:18). In response, Peter boldly defies the 
religious leader's injunction, proclaiming he desires to obey God rather than 
man (4:19, 5:29). Despite persecution, the apostles rejoice they are counted 
worthy to suffer dishonor for the name of Jesus (5:41). The witness in 
Jerusalem culminates in the stoning of Stephen (7:54-60).

Stephen's martyrdom scatters the church throughout the regions of Judea and 
Samaria (8:1). Philip proclaims the gospel in Samaria (8:1-7) and evangelizes 
an Ethiopian eunuch (8:26-40). Saul is converted on the road to Damascus 
(9:1-19) and is received by the apostles (9:26-28). Peter preaches the gospel 
in Lydda and Joppa which are cities of Samaria (9:32-43). Peter visits 
Cornelius in Caesarea (another city in Samaria) to explain the gospel, leading 
to the conversion of Cornelius and his entire household (10:34-43). Remarkably, 
the Holy Spirit falls upon those Gentiles who hear the word (10:44-48), 
demonstrating God's acceptance of the Gentiles in the New Covenant church. 
Initially, the circumcision party criticizes Peter for dining with 
uncircumcised men (11:2). However, after Peter relays his vision and the coming 
of the Holy Spirit upon the Gentiles, his critics recognize God's plan to grant 
Gentiles repentance and salvation (11:18). The apostles experience further 
persecution as the gospel spreads throughout Judea and Samaria. Herod the king 
kills James and imprisons Peter (12:1-3), but an angel rescues Peter from 
prison and the believers rejoice (12:6-17).

As for the spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth, Paul and Barnabas are 
selected by the Holy Spirit to evangelize the world (13:1-3). Repeatedly, Paul 
is persecuted by both Jews and Gentiles, suffering unjustly for the cause of 
the gospel. He is stoned at Lystra (14:19), imprisoned in Philippi (16:16-24), 
chased out of Thessalonica (17:10) and Berea (17:14), caught up in a violent 
riot in Ephesus (19:21-41), arrested in the temple in Jerusalem (21:27-36), 
tried before the Jews (22:30-23:1-10), almost assassinated (23:12-22), tried 
before Felix the Governer (24:1-21), tried before Agrippa (25:13-26:1-32), and 
shipwrecked (27:39-44). Despite all these trials, Paul maintains his singular 
passion of finishing the ministry he received from the Lord Jesus - to testify 
to the gospel of the grace of God (20:24). Paul also encounters positive 
reception to the gospel: the proconsul believes in Paphos (13:12); those in 
Antioch in Pisidia receive the gospel with great eagerness (13:44,48-49); Lydia 
(16:11-15) and the Philippian jailer (16:25-34) are converted; many in 
Thessalonica believe (17:4), the Bereans receive the word with eagerness 
(17:11); some in Athens believe (17:34); many Corinthians believe and are 
baptized (18:8); and disciples in Ephesus are baptized with the Holy Spirit 
(19:1-10). The final episode of Acts relates Paul's confrontations with the 
Roman elite. In particular, he is given the opportunity to testify before Felix 
the governor (24:1-21), Festus the governor (25:1-12), and King Agrippa (ch. 
26). Paul appeals to Caesar during his trial with Festus (25:11) and embarks on 
a journey to Rome. Enduring a storm (27:13-38) and a shipwreck (27:39-44), Paul 
finally arrives in Rome. Acts concludes with Paul under house arrest, 
proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with 
all boldness and without hindrance (28:30).

<p>
In short, Acts provides a glimpse into the development of the early church. 
Ultimately, believing is a work of God in the hearts of sinners (2:47, 13:48, 
John 6:29). Therefore, the gospel message flourishes in cities which God 
chooses to bless and falls on deaf ears in cities which God chooses to harden. 
Indeed, this is also true for the modern church. Thus, all evangelistic 
endeavors must wholly depend upon the sovereign grace and operation of the 
Triune God.
