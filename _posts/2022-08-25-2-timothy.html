excerpt: "A brief commentary of 2 Timothy"
---

<p>
2 Timothy can be described as his ‘farewell discourse’ to Timothy. When he penned this letter, he was a prisoner in a dark and cold Roman cell, with little hope of escaping (4:6). This was during the Neronian persecution, when Christians were used as scapegoats after the Great Fire of Rome. In this final letter, he encourages Timothy to be firm in his faith, to live a godly life, to suffer for the gospel, and to preach fearlessly.

Paul begins the letter expressing his personal desire to reunite with Timothy. Paul’s tone is tender and gentle right from the beginning of the letter, like that of a father speaking to his son. This fatherly tone is evident throughout in Paul’s exhortations, encouragements, and warnings. Some examples include Paul exhorting Timothy to fan into flame the gift of God (1:6), guard the good deposit entrusted to him (1:14), entrust the gospel to faithful men who can teach others (2:2), flee from youthful passions (2:22), and preach the word in and out of season (4:2). In summary, Paul encourages Timothy, spurring him towards love and good works.

Paul also reminds Timothy of his spiritual heritage. In the opening chapter, he speaks of the faith passed down to him from his grandmother and mother and now dwells within him (1:5). Later, he highlights Timothy’s obedience to his teachings and commends him for it (3:10-11). In this connection, Paul warns Timothy that sin will be pervasive in the last days (3:1-5) and that those who desire to live a godly life will be persecuted (3:12). People will cease to desire sound teaching (4:3-4) and there will be many who explicitly oppose the gospel (4:14-15). Therefore, Paul urges Timothy not to be discouraged or faint in his preaching of the word of God (4:2).

<p>
2 Timothy is a letter from a spiritual father to his spiritual child. The exhortations, encouragements and warnings are delivered lovingly. Bearing the gospel of Jesus Christ in a crooked and twisted generation (Phil. 2:15) is not an easy task; indeed, it brings much suffering (3:12). God provided Timothy with a godly role model and the requisite gifts for ministry (1:6), so that Timothy might be equipped to fill in what was lacking in the church at Ephesus, for the furtherance of the Kingdom of Christ.
