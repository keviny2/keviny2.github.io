excerpt: "A brief commentary of The Gospel according to John"

<p>
The gospel of John is likely the last gospel account to be written. Penned by 
the apostle John, the disciple whom Jesus loved, it expands on three distinct 
points: the divinity of Christ, the Trinity, and salvation. 
</p>

<p>
John’s opening verse introduces the Logos and its relationship with the divine 
(1:1). The concept of the logos reaches back to Ancient Greek philosophy, where 
it describes a kind of ’universal divine reason’, or simply put, the mind of 
God. In contrast to Ancient Greek philosophy’s understanding of the Logos - it 
being perceived more-so as an abstract idea, John argues that the logos 
possesses personality. Moreover, in the opening section (1:1-18), John claims 
that the logos takes on flesh and dwelt alongside man. This idea is 
revolutionary, which in part explains the intense backlash Jesus experiences 
for attributing divinity to himself during his earthly ministry. Perhaps Jesus’ 
most notable claim to divinity is found in his discourse with the Jews (who 
believed him!) when he said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I 
am.” (8:58). In this statement, Jesus asserts his eternality, which is an 
attribute only God possesses. Throughout the gospel of John, Jesus declares 
himself to be equal with God (5:18), sent by God (7:28-29), given authority to 
judge (5:22), doing the works of God (10:38) and having life in himself (5:26). 
Moreover, Jesus’ teachings are validated by miracles: the claim to equality 
with God and having authority to judge is validated by the healing at the pool 
(5:1-17); the claim to being sent by God is validated by the feeding of the 
5000 (6:1-15); the claim to performing the very works of God is validated by 
the healing of the man born blind (ch.9) . Even more, the famous seven ‘I am’ 
statements are also authenticated by signs, which further bolsters Jesus’ 
teachings. In short, Jesus certainly believes himself to be divine and 
substantiates his radical claims through miracles.

<p>
Another revolutionary idea John introduces in his gospel is the Trinity. Jesus 
establishes the Son and Father relation within the Trinity in various places 
throughout the gospel account. For instance, in a discourse with the disciples, 
Jesus speaks of his closeness with the Father. Namely, that those who have seen 
him have seen the Father (14:9); that the Father does his works through Jesus 
Christ (14:10); and that he is in the Father and the Father is in him (14:11). 
Also, during the Feast of Dedication, Jesus proclaims himself to be one with 
the Father (10:30). In the High Priestly Prayer, Jesus prays, “All mine are 
yours, and yours are mine” (17:10) - indicating that the Father and Son share 
ownership of the elect.  As it is, the degree of intimacy between the Son and 
the Father suggest an identical essence. In the case of the Holy Spirit, John 
describes Him to perform works only God can do. These include: giving life 
(3:6,8); proclaiming the future (16:13); and indwelling believers (14:17). John 
tightly weaves together the works of the three Persons of the Trinity such that 
they are inseparable; this is chiefly evident in the gift of salvation.
</p>

<p>
John is ultimately concerned with converting his readers - “but these are 
written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and 
that by believing you may have life in his name” (20:31). There is a sharp 
contrast between darkness and light throughout the book - light denoting 
salvation and fellowship with God while darkness denoting death and separation 
from God (1:5; 3:19). Additionally, Moses and Christ are contrasted - Moses the 
giver of the law and Christ the usher of grace and truth (1:17). Those who 
believe in Jesus may have life in his name. The dispensation of the gifts of 
salvation can only come through the sufferings of Christ. Jesus lives the 
perfect life to satisfy the righteous requirements of the law (Rom. 8:3-4) and 
dies to make atonement for our sins (Gal. 3:13; 2 Cor. 5:21). Jesus, the 
God-man, takes on flesh (1:14) and proclaims the gospel to the helpless. What 
an amazing thought; the Creator of the Universe, being pleased to go to such 
great lengths to save sinners! “but God shows his love for us in that while we 
were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom 5:8).
</p>

<p>
In short, the gospel according to John is an account of the life, ministry and 
death of the Son, the Second Person of the Trinity. It focuses on the divinity 
of Christ and expresses the awesome work of redemption by the Triune God. 
Salvation is only found in the God-man. This is most pertinently communicated 
by the Second Person of the Trinity Himself, “I am the way, and the truth, and 
the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6).
