Hello! I'm Kevin, a consultant at <a href="https://www.amaris.com/">Amaris 
Consulting</a>. My current project centers around the development of API
tools tailored to process single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. Concurrently, I am
contributing to open-source projects developing data structures for genomic
experiments.
<br><br>
During my time at UBC, I had the honor of contributing to cancer research. 
I implemented <a href="https://github.com/Roth-Lab/LiquidBayes/">
LiquidBayes</a>, a state-of-the-art Bayesian model to estimate tumour 
burden for monitoring cancer progression using liquid biopsies.
<br><br>
Most importantly, I'm a husband and a father. Take a look at some
<a href="/about/">photos</a>! I also serve as a Ruling Elder at
<a href="https://faithvan.com/">Faith Reformed Presbyterian Church</a>.
