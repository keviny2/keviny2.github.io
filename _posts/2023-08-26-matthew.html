excerpt: "A brief commentary of The Gospel according to Matthew"
---

<p>
The gospel of Matthew introduces the life, ministry, and work of Christ. The 
Jewish 'flavor' of the gospel according to Matthew serves as an organic 
transition into the New Testament. In this connection, Matthew quotes the Old 
Testament over 60 times, at multiple occasions references Old Testament 
promises, and emphasizes Jesus as the Messiah and Saviour of Israel.

<p>
Chapter 1 opens with the genealogy of Jesus. Notably, Jesus is a descendant of 
both Abraham and David. Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem elicits varying reactions 
from different people; the Magi bow in adoration, whereas Herod commits 
infanticide in an attempt to kill baby Jesus. This theme of contrary responses 
to the person of Christ runs throughout the entire gospel.

<p>
The ministry of Christ begins in chapter 4 with his baptism and temptation. 
After these things, from chapters 5-7, he preaches the well-known Sermon on the 
Mount, where he expounds the true meaning of the Law and the Prophets (5:20). 
Herein we observe a clear shift of focus from the letter of the law to the 
Spirit of the law.

<p>
From chapters  8-10, the miraculous ministry of Jesus begins; he heals 
sicknesses, casts out demons, and even subdues nature. Specific examples 
include the healing of the leper (8:1-4), the healing of the centurion's 
servant (8:5-13), the calming of the storm (8:23-27), and the healing of the 
two blind men (9:27-31). Furthermore, Jesus' preaching ministry is at its core, 
a spiritual healing ministry (9:9-13). In chapter 10, Jesus gives the Twelve 
power to perform miracles and sends them on an evangelistic mission.

<p>
From chapters 11-15, Jesus speaks to John's disciples about his identity, and 
the Pharisees on the source of his authority and the importance of tradition. 
Jesus uses parables to illustrate his points, so that only those to whom God 
reveals the meaning will understand. Chapters 16-17 give us a glimpse into the 
deity of Christ at the mount of Transfiguration.
</p>

<p>
From roughly chapter 18 onwards, Jesus begins teaching the 'inversion 
principle' - the first will be last and the last will be first. Also, further 
attention is given regarding the sufferings of Christ. We first encounter the 
inversion principle when Jesus speaks on the childlikeness of the believer and 
when he welcomes the little children. In this case, the natural order of adults 
and children is inverted. The story of the rich young ruler in chapter 19 
inverts the common notion that the rich are above the poor. In chapter 20, 
Jesus responds to the mother of James and John by saying that the greatest in 
the kingdom is a servant. Chapter 21 gives us another discourse between Jesus 
and the Pharisees, where Jesus uses parables, such as the two sons and the 
tenants, to invert the religious order of those days concerning the religious 
elite (Pharisees) and sinners. Finally, the parable of the wedding feast in 
chapter 22 inverts the ethnic order between Jews and Gentiles. In that parable, 
those invited to the wedding feast, but did not attend, represent the Jews; in 
contrast, those invited from the streets and did attend, represent the 
Gentiles. 
</p>

<p>
These instances are to direct our attention to Jesus, who, “being in the form 
of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped” (Phil. 2:6). 
Jesus empties himself by becoming a servant, and subjects himself to a 
humiliating death by crucifixion (Phil. 2:8). He is the perfect example, the 
perfect illustration, and the perfect manifestation of this principle. Jesus 
the Messiah, betrayed by his own people; none by his side at his crucifixion, 
save a handful of women; denied by his best friend three times; handed over to 
the mob to be crucified, though found innocent; regarded as worse than a 
murderer; mocked, scorned, and struck - Jesus bore all this shame for the 
redemption of sinners. Oh the breadth, length, height and depth of the love of 
Christ! Truly it surpasses all understanding!
</p>

<p>
In summary, Matthew provides us with a simple, yet powerful, account of the 
life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Messiah humbles himself by 
taking on a human body and our infirmities. He exalts the lowly and humbles the 
proud. He is obedient even to death on a cross and is raised from the dead. He 
is Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.
