excerpt: "A brief commentary of Jude"
---

<p>
The epistle of Jude addresses the topic of false teachers and parallels 
chapters 2 and 3 of 2 Peter (see the <a href="/biblical%20commentary/2-peter/">summary for 2 Peter</a>). After handling false 
teachers, Jude calls Christians to persevere, "But you, beloved, building 
yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, keep 
yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ 
that leads to eternal life." (v. 20-21) To close, Jude provides the church with 
one of the most precious doxologies found in Scripture, "Now to him who is able 
to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of 
his glory with great joy, to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our 
Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and 
forever. Amen." (v. 24-25) God does not merely grant us salvation, He also 
sustains us by keeping us from stumbling. Although the flesh is prone to 
wander, the good Shepherd always leads His sheep back home.
