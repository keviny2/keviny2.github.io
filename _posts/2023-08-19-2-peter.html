excerpt: "A brief commentary of 2 Peter"
---

<p>
2 Peter is penned by the apostle Peter to Christians facing persecution. Its 
intent is to stir up the believer's sincere mind by way of reminder (3:1). 2 
Peter addresses how Christians ought to live in hostile environments, what they 
should hold fast to, the condemnation of false teachers and the believer's 
perseverance in the last days.

Peter opens this letter with a magnificent exposition of the transforming grace 
of God. This grace is given through the knowledge of Christ (1:3) and brings 
with it many precious promises (1:4). Accordingly, Peter exhorts Christians to 
live holy lives despite dwelling in a pagan society and in doing so, confirm 
their election (1:10). In this connection, Peter lists Christian attributes 
that believers should strive for (1:5-7). Especially in times of hardship, 
God’s grace sanctifies and empowers believers to grow in the fruits of the 
Spirit.

Significantly, Peter does not leave the church lacking something tangible to 
hold fast to. Christians can be confident because they have the written Word of 
God. The apostles were eyewitnesses of the Transfiguration and testified that 
Jesus indeed was the Son of God. The Spirit works through the reading and 
preaching of the Scriptures to produce those Christian virtues. Therefore, it 
is important for Christians to be diligent in reading, meditating upon, and 
applying the Scriptures habitually.

Peter spends much time warning against false teachers. The early church faced 
both external and internal persecutions, and it was through false teachers that 
heresies infiltrated the church (2:13). False teachers are described as morally 
corrupt (2:10-16) and enslaved to sin (2:19). In contrast, believers are 
described as being set free from sin by the grace of Christ. False teachers 
will face God’s judgment for the harm they inflict upon God’s people through 
their teachings. Peter makes a clear distinction between the godly and ungodly; 
just how Lot and Noah were saved from God’s judgments, so too will the 
righteous be rescued from trials (2:9).

Finally, Peter reminds the churches to wait patiently for the Day of the Lord. 
Although many scoffers will arise to malign the promises of God (3:3), Peter 
encourages believers to stand firm in their faith. He reasons that God tarries 
because he is waiting for the whole number of the elect to enter the fold 
(3:9). Since one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day 
(3:8), the Lord is not slow to fulfill his promises, although it may seem to be 
so according to human standards. In short, Peter exhorts Christians in all 
places to persevere in holy living as they wait expectantly for the coming of 
the Lord.
