excerpt: "A brief commentary of Colossians"
---

<p>
In this epistle, Paul upholds Christ’s deity and communicates Christ’s 
pre-eminence. He attacks heresy promoting asceticism circulating throughout the 
church, leading people away from trusting in the work of Christ. Paul argues 
that no worldly philosophy can act as a sufficient substitute for the gospel of 
Christ. After defending his position, he provides practical instructions on 
Christian living.

<p>
Paul addresses the Colossians with a personal greeting (1:1-2) and an 
encouragement to persevere in the Christian life (1:3-14). Although Paul did 
not found the church in Colossae, it is evident that he cared for the spiritual 
needs of its members. Paul is thankful for their faith (1:3-4) and constantly 
prays for them to grow in knowledge, good works and joy. Paul lists those who 
are laboring alongside him in the ministry of the gospel, each advancing the 
gospel using their particular gifts (4:7-17).

Following this brief greeting, Paul enters into his main discussion point - the 
impotence of worldly philosophy and the omnipotence of Christ. Worldly 
philosophy possesses an appearance of wisdom (2:23); however, only in Christ is 
hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (2:3). Moreover, there is no 
efficacy in worldly philosophy, for it is powerless to mortify the flesh 
(2:23). On the contrary, the wisdom of Christ is efficacious. For we have been 
reconciled to God (1:22) and have been made alive by God together with Christ 
(2:13), putting to death our old self (3:5) and exercising righteousness 
(3:12-13) by Christ’s wisdom. Consequently, Paul instructs the Colossians to 
let the word of Christ dwell richly in them (3:16). This instruction applies to 
all Christians, because God’s Word is the means by which the Holy Spirit 
accomplishes the work of sanctification. Therefore, the Christian must hunger 
and thirst for the Word of God. From the Lord himself, “Sanctify them in the 
truth; your word is truth.” (John 17:17).

Finally, Paul leaves the Colossians with various rules for Christian relations. 
Wives are to submit to their husbands (3:18); husbands are to love their wives 
(3:19); children are to obey their parents (3:20); fathers are not to provoke 
their children (3:21); bond servants are to sincerely obey their masters 
(3:22-24); masters are to treat their bond servants justly and fairly (4:1). To 
conclude, this epistle can be summarized as a call to abound in thanksgiving 
(2:7) and to put on love (3:14). These two principles will help guide the 
Christian in all his dealings and relationships - leading to deeper intimacy 
with Christ himself and his church.
