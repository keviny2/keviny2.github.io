excerpt: "A brief commentary of Titus"
---

<p>
Titus was one of apostle Paulâ€™s co-workers, who accompanied him during his 
ministry on the island of Crete. Paul left Titus in charge of appointing elders 
in the Cretan churches while he continued on his evangelistic mission. This 
epistle to Titus highlights the importance of the church in the work of 
sanctification, which is manifested by good works.

<p>
The foremost task given to Titus is the appointing of elders in every town 
(1:5). Paul lists the qualifications for elders (1:6-9) which remains relevant 
for those who are called to this office today. In a way, the whole list is a 
footnote to the first qualification - being above reproach. As it is, no man is 
sinless; but there is through the power of the Holy Spirit, the ability to 
mortify the deeds of the body (Rom. 8:13) so as to in a sense, be above 
reproach in word and deed. Faithful men who are called to the office of elder, 
by much prayer and trust in God, may strive to meet these qualifications. Paul 
also warns Titus to guard against false teachings that infiltrate the church. 
Elders are responsible for rebuking those who contradict the truth (1:9), in 
order to protect the purity of the church.

<p>
Moreover, Paul charges Titus to be a model of good works (2:7). Good leaders 
practice what they preach. There are different kinds of good works that Paul 
associates with various kinds of people based on age and sex. For example, 
older women are to be reverent in behaviour (2:3), while younger men are to be 
self-controlled (2:6). The grace of God trains Christians to eschew all 
lawlessness and embrace good works (2:14); therefore, Christians ought to be 
careful to devote themselves to good works (3:8). Accordingly, it is the grace 
of God which empowers believers to perform good works. Although good works play 
a special role in the work of salvation, they are not the instrumental cause of 
salvation. Instead, it is solely through the mercy of God, by the Holy Spirit, 
that one is saved (3:5).

<p>
In short, the book of Titus instructs churches to appoint elders who are able 
to teach sound doctrine and model good works for the edification of the church. 
The grace of God works in and through believers, enabling them to do the good 
works prepared for them before the foundation of the world (Eph. 2:10). Indeed, 
the Christian should be careful to devote himself to good works (3:8) - not as 
a means to acquire salvation, but rather as a reflection of the their renewed 
nature.
