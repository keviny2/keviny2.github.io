<h1>Education</h1>
I am currently finishing my MSc. in Bioinformatics at the University of British Columbia (UBC), working at the BC Cancer Agency under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Roth. I received my BSc. in Computer Science and Statistics with distinction, also at UBC in the Winter of 2020.

<h1>Research</h1>
As part of my MSc. thesis, I am developing a Bayesian network named <em>LiquidBayes</em> to infer clonal prevalences in cancer patients. <em>LiquidBayes</em> integrates biological information from previously inferred copy number (CN) profiles with cell free DNA (cfDNA) in liquid biopsies to monitor treatment progression. Incidentally, I constructed various bioinformatics pipelines to perform GC/mappability bias correction in read count data and somatic variant calling. <em>LiquidBayes</em> is implemented in Python using the Pyro Probabilistic Programming Language (PPL). My research is partly funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) CGS+M scholarship.
