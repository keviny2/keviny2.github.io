excerpt: "A brief commentary of 1 Timothy"
---

<p>
Paul writes this epistle to Timothy to instruct him in matters pertaining to 
church life. At the time, Timothy was charged to shepherd the church at Ephesus 
because Paul was leaving for Macedonia (1:3). In this connection, Paul 
instructs Timothy to keep a close guard on his lifestyle to set an example for 
the flock.  Moreover, Paul charges Timothy to be prepared to tackle various 
issues that may arise in the complex of church life. In this epistle, Paul 
walks through issues the church in Ephesus was facing at the time and explains 
how to remedy each.

False teachers were beginning to infiltrate the church in Ephesus and promote 
unprofitable ideas (1:3-4) leading to vain discussion (1:6). Paul urges Timothy 
to stop these false teachers from spreading false doctrine (1:3), noting that 
’a little leaven leavens the whole lump’. It is extremely important to guard 
against false teaching so that those in the church who are weaker do not fall 
prey to deception. Paul recognizes there will inevitably be some who depart 
from the faith and embrace false doctrine (4:1). Despite this, he reminds 
Timothy that every minister has the responsibility to combat false teaching and 
persist in the truth for the benefit of his flock (4:16).

Next, Paul goes through various aspects of church life. First, he distinguishes 
between the roles of men and women; namely, men should engage in prayer for all 
people (2:1,8)  and women are to learn quietly in submissiveness (2:12). Then 
Paul enumerates the qualities of overseers and deacons chapter 3. 
Interestingly, both overseers and deacons must manage their own households well 
(3:4, 12), so as to prove they are able to care for a smaller household before 
moving on to a larger spiritual household. Paul also provides instruction on 
how the church ought to help widows. He makes it very clear that the primary 
source of aid should come from the widows’ own household (5:4). Only in the 
case when the widow has no relatives, must the church bear the responsibility 
to provide (5:16). For elders, Paul teaches that they are to be honoured in the 
church (5:17), provided for monetarily (5:18), and guarded against false 
accusations (5:19). Regarding master and slave relationships, Paul exhorts 
slaves to respect their masters and serve them wholeheartedly whether they are 
in the faith or not (6:1-2).

Finally, Paul describes the godly life. Godliness is of great value and holds 
promise for both this life and the life to come (4:8). Paul advises Timothy not 
to get involved with the doctrine of false teachers (4:7). Note, no matter how 
firm someone is in their doctrine, they must be wary not to get entangled with 
vain and meaningless teachings. Rather, the good servant of Christ Jesus will 
deliver truth to the church (4:6); this is primarily done through the public 
reading of Scripture, exhortation, and teaching (4:13). After addressing the 
issue of false doctrine, Paul addresses the issue of true contentment. The 
consequence of true contentment is contentment with very little (6:8). The 
godly man must not be greedy, but generous (6:17-19); he must flee from the sin 
of discontentment and pursue instead righteousness, godliness, faith, love, 
steadfastness, gentleness (6:11).

Although 1 Timothy is Paul’s personal letter to Timothy over two millennia ago, 
it provides incalculable value for the present day church. 1 Timothy 
establishes the importance of faithful leaders in the church and explains how a 
church ought to operate. Church life is crucial to every believer; those who 
are in position of leadership in the church must be dedicated to feeding their 
flock, and those in the church must adopt the principle of charity. False 
teachers will certainly enter the church to devour and destroy, so the church 
must always be on guard. What Paul wrote to Timothy two millennia ago is just 
as relevant to every Christian today: “Fight the good fight of the faith” 
(6:12).
