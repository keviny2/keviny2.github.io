<h1>Tree-Based Methods</h1>
Tree-based methods are a great way to learn patterns in data. They are extremely interpretable, making them a useful tool for communicating findings in data science applications. Moreover, extensions to simpler tree-based methods exist which are competitive in prediction accuracy. We first begin with the basics through an example.

<h2>Regression and Classification Trees</h2>
Assume we are trying to predict the salary of a baseball player based on two
characteristics: the number of years they played in the major leagues, and the
number of hits they had last season. A possible tree that we might end up
with can be seen in Figure 1. There are two places where the tree is split:
Years<4.5 and Hits<117.5. These are the tree’s internal nodes, and we call the
split conditions Years<4.5 and Hits<117.5 ’splitting rules’.
