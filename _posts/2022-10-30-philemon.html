excerpt: "A brief commentary of Philemon"

<p>
The epistle to Philemon is the last of Paul’s letters in the New Testament. 
Matthew Henry notes that it is incredible such a small letter was preserved 
throughout the ages and was ultimately included in the canon of Scripture.

<p>
This epistle addresses the broken relationship between a master (Philemon) and 
his slave (Onesimus). According to tradition, it is believed that Onesimus 
stole property from Philemon and ran from Colossae (where Philemon lived) to 
Rome. Upon entering Rome, providence led him to hear the apostle Paul’s 
preaching by which he was converted.

<p>
The interactions between Paul, Onesimus and Philemon resemble the mediation and 
intercession of Christ to the Father on behalf of believers. Paul intercedes 
for Onesimus, whom he calls his child (v.10) and asks Philemon to receive his 
runaway slave as a brother (v.16). Furthermore, Paul offers to repay any 
outstanding debt Onesimus owes (v.18). In this connection, Paul finds it 
necessary that Philemon receives Onesimus out of goodness and not compulsion 
(v.14).

<p>
Paul's willingness to pay for Onesimus' debt mirrors Christ's willingness to 
bear the wages of his people's sins on the cross. Moreover, the gospel does not 
portray the Father as reluctantly forgiving and loving those whom Jesus died 
for. Jesus declares, “and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on 
your behalf, for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and 
have believed that I came from God” (John 16:26-27), indicating the believer’s 
relationship with the Father is truly reconciled, thus allowing him to approach 
the throne of grace with confidence in times of need (Heb. 4:16). The story of 
Philemon is analogous to the story of redemption; a servant who transgresses 
the law and deserves punishment is shown mercy and grace by the one offended 
through the mediation of another who is willing to repay the debt. Praise be to 
God!
